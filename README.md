# POI-ROI-map
Life science - an American thing? The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown that European research institutions &amp; companies are very well capable of making their contribution to the global fight for health. However, it is very easy to loose overview about which interesting life science facilities exist in Europe. The original intention of this little ROI-map project was to simplify your job search by enabling you to mark individual regions and points of interest (ROIs &amp; POIs). Nonetheless, the script can also be used for any other purpose! A simple .xlsx spreadsheet serves you as an easy-to-access "database" and let you define the respective coordinates. Available marker elements are ROIs, distance as well as POI markers. All elements can be color-coded, the POIs can be further specified by info-popups and are automatically clustered with respect to the current zoom setting. Moreover, multiple map representations are available also including a satellite view. Have fun to play around.
